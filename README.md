# domj.net

This is the project portfolio of Dominik Jančík.

## Overview

The app fetches data from Contentful and uses React Context for global state management. No content editing is currently available from within the app.

## Useful Hooks

### Data sources

#### `useCollections()`

Fetches and returns collections

#### `useQuery()`

Returns URLSearchParams based on the current URL query or hash strings

## Available Scripts

The app is based on create-react-app, so all standard scripts apply.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
The app is ready to be deployed!
